# Why I decided to build this website

Ever since I started looking at academia a bit more seriously as a career path for myself, I decided to try and build an online presence of my own.

Multiple fellow academics, researchers and writers have advocated for personal branding in academia, the importance of maintaining an online presence regarding research develop

Additionally, building an online presence that is regularly updated can increase one's chances when looking for their next academic opportunity. 

Some examples include the following posts in a series of different websites/platforms:

* [Should your academic CV (or résumé) go digital, at last?](https://medium.com/advice-and-help-in-authoring-a-phd-or-non-fiction/should-your-resum%C3%A9-or-cv-go-digital-at-last-23ef784c013b#.yq7vhcaqz)
* [The Ins and Outs of a Professional Academic Website](http://theprofessorisin.com/2012/02/07/the-ins-and-outs-of-a-professional-academic-website-guest-post-2/)
* [Creating a simple and effective academic personal website](https://www.elsevier.com/connect/creating-a-simple-and-effective-academic-personal-website)

An additional concern I wanted to address with this website was to avoid a typical case of online academic obscurity. At multiple occasions, I have tried to look into researchers' work

Finally, one might argue that for purposes similar to mine there already exist several established "players" that aim to allow academic researchers to maintain an online presence and to connect with each other. Examples include [Academia.edu](https://www.academia.edu/) and [Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.com/).

Even though I maintain profiles in both academic "social networks" I wanted an additional space that I could tailor specifically to my own needs that would also allow me to host __. Therefore, with this website I can also maintain an HTML and a PDF version of my CV, a blog with which I can discuss various topics. Overall, I find my website to be complementary to these academic networks and this is also why I provide links to my profiles at the sidebar of the website.

# How did I build this website

## The first effort(s)

Initially, as soon as I decided that I want to build an online presence I had a look to find examples that I could follow or even blatantly copy. What I was looking for was the structure of the website, the platform on which to develop it and where to host it.

As at the time I was still an MSc student at [Imperial College London](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/) I looked at what I still believe is one of the best academic websites out there: the one by [Dr. James Keirstead](http://www.jameskeirstead.ca/)

Therefore, I embarked by building a Wordpress website. Other solutions like Squarespace or Tumblr did not cross my mind at the time as I also wanted to familiarize myself with the Wordpress platform.

## Github pages

After giving up on Wordpress but not on the idea of an academic website

I followed a similar process as before. I chose a topic that was aesthetically pleasing to me

In this case the theme was [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon), a Jekyll theme that is based on [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).
