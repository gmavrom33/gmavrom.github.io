I am Eli, a biomedical engineer, computational biologist and doctor.

My latest research relates to the [interface between the human immune system and the microbiome][almlab]. You can find a list of my publications on [Google scholar][].

I graduated from the [University of Toronto][] with a bachelor in [Engineering Science][]. I continued my path in biomedical engineering with a S.M. in mechanical engineering at [MIT][] and a Ph.D from the [Harvard/MIT Health Science & Technology Institute][].

I have trained as a physician at [Imperial College London medical school][] and I currently live and work as a doctor in London,UK.
