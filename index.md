Hi! I am a PhD student in the [Chair of Building Physics][] at [ETH Zurich][] involved in Urban Energy Systems research and this is my personal webpage.

You can find information about the research I do for [my PhD][] or visit my [blog][] where I discuss things that could be related to my work or maybe not.

Before doing my PhD, I graduated from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki][] with a MEng in [Mechanical Engineering][]. I continued my path [Imperial College London][] from where I graduated with an [MSc in Sustainable Energy Futures][].
