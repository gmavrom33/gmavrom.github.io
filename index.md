Hi, I am Georgios, but people usually call me George. :bowtie:

Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Chair of Building Physics][] at [ETH Zurich][] involved in Urban Energy Systems research.

Before that, I graduated from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki][] with a MEng in [Mechanical Engineering][]. I continued my path [Imperial College London][] from where I graduated with an [MSc in Sustainable Energy Futures][].
