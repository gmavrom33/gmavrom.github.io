I am a highly motivated and fast learner that is seeking a position into the web development world so I can improve my skills and became a better developer.

My interest in technology and code began when I started blogging and use Mac OS X. Now I find myself learning and spending most the time with anything that is web related. 

I feel comfortable working with Javascript, any CSS preprocessor and lately I really enjoy use version control systems and work with the shell.
